This program is a fork of the hcpy console-based RPN calculator written by
Don Peterson. The original project website is here:

The fork was made because this project's owner, Vernon Mauery, wanted a
calculator which satisfied his every whim, and felt that his whims might
not align precisely with Don's whims.
